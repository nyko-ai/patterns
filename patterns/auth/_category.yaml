description: "Authentication and authorization patterns for modern web applications"
icon: "shield"

patterns:
  - supabase-client-nextjs
  - supabase-google-oauth
  - supabase-github-oauth
  - supabase-magic-link
  - supabase-protected-routes
  - supabase-signout
  - nextauth-credentials
  - nextauth-google

recommended_order:
  # Supabase path
  - supabase-client-nextjs  # Always first - sets up the client
  - supabase-protected-routes  # Then middleware
  - supabase-google-oauth  # Or other auth method
  - supabase-signout  # Finally signout
  # NextAuth path
  - nextauth-google  # Or nextauth-credentials
  - nextauth-credentials  # Can combine with Google OAuth

notes: |
  Supabase patterns require the base client setup (supabase-client-nextjs).
  NextAuth patterns are standalone and use Prisma adapter.
  Choose either Supabase OR NextAuth - don't mix them in the same project.
